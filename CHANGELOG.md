# Changelog

## 2022-10-28 21:35:04

- Add an `index` to the text add/remove process ensure consistent ordering of prompt
- Improve delta detection by grouping together text edits that are a package deal
  - This ensures that original images can be regenerated by reversing the delta
- Allow for bulk generation of all visible place holder images
- Default to card view
- Tighten the width on the create prompt page - also allow the TextArea to grow as needed

## 2022-10-27 23:32:49

- Improve display of `ImageGrid` by showing a card view that emphasizes all images in group

## 2022-10-23 22:04:51

- Move the old `loose` transforms into the same bucket as the "unknown" -- these are all meant to be prompt edits
- Force those loose ones to be normalized so that they produce the add/remove style instead of the `set` style
  - This works except for when editing something at the start of a prompt...
- Adds support for the `extraChoices` with the new xform builder
- Add a prompt xform button in the first column of the row -- should probably only show for main image?
- Move `gen` button to top so it's never hidden on long prompts
- Allow prompt builder thing to be reset -- probably should happen automatically?
- Remove `loose` as a variable choice - prompt changes now in `unknown`
- Improve how the `mainImage` is selected - explicit button instead of clicking in the cell
