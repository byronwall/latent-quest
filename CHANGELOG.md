## 2022-10-23 22:04:51

- Move the old `loose` transforms into the same bucket as the "unknown" -- these are all meant to be prompt edits
- Force those loose ones to be normalized so that they produce the add/remove style instead of the `set` style
  - This works except for when editing something at the start of a prompt...
- Adds support for the `extraChoices` with the new xform builder
- Add a prompt xform button in the first column of the row -- should probably only show for main image?
- Move `gen` button to top so it's never hidden on long prompts
- Allow prompt builder thing to be reset -- probably should happen automatically?

## 2022-10-17 22:12:54

- Allow images to be saved to `/tmp` -- avoid excess S3 calls
  - Also track bad files and do not load more than once -- will need to track count or something
- Remove prompt pieces -- all are now "unknown"

- Remove bad image groups
- Move server to /api folder
- Move all secrets into .env file for environment access
