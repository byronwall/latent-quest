Sub builder:
    ☐ Add a quick build to run X new seeds from the same image

Image editor:
    ☐ Allow for mutliply or other operations that add color without overdoing things
    ☐ Allow for assorted brush strokes to add splotches of color
    ☐ Look into context filters for image mods - https://stackoverflow.com/a/67392978/4288101
        ☐ Or use sharp and send back and forth to the client

    ☐ Improve out painting controls:
        ☐ Ability to move image around
        ☐ Add some default pixels instead of black bars

DALL-E related:
    ☐ Figure out how to handle the grid when using DALL-E since seed is not real - maybe use `seed` even though it's not real?

Variants and related:
    ☐ Allow the variant strength to be part of the image grid

Image Grid:
    ☐ main image is being lost when the grid reloads -- find some way to not lose this @critical
    ☐ Remove the `xform` choices
    ☐ Integrate the `modify` mode into the `edit` prompt -- add some toggles for whether the image is retained or dropped in the process.
    ☐ add ability to compare images side by side
    ☐ tighten the table visuals to reduce white space
    ☐ show active prompt for main image (and other details too?)
    ☐ add `imageSize` back into the settings - control with a slider in ticks of 50px this time

    ☐ ability to change sort order of grid -- default appears to be descending
    ☐ sort by date within the groups so new images are first
    ☐ Use a sticky or something for the previous image so it's always in frame
    ☐ Show the total number of `gen all` options that will be generated for a study (avoid massive requests)

    ☐ Add an explicit popup to create a study based on a main image -- take the current interface pieces and move them into a modal -- does a popup work better for most operations? -- before/after
    ☐ Allow choosing the preview image(s) for the social graph image

    ☐ For large image studies, allow the user to choose the specific options to display
        ☐ Then allow linking to those specific views
        ☐ This would back creating subsets of large views
        ☐ Default = render a subset; instead of rendering everything everytime

Card viewer:
    ☐ Find some way to mark "study" images as part of a grid instead of as previous images

Sub Chooser related:
    ☐ Allow a choice to use either the modal selections or all active items in group

Random:
    ☐ allow deleting single images
    ☐ allow creating new groups from an existing study or survey -- keep the image url -- add a `prevGroupId` -- new groupId -- new image id?
    ☐ add a 1D / walk mode which tracks the `previousId` and shows as a directed acyclic graph
    ☐ try the `AppShell` for the NavBar and other stuff
    ☐ Allow rating or loving images / sub values -- start to aggregate "good" or "popular" choices instead of very long lists
    ☐ Ability to search Lexica and bring an image into current study

Prompt editor:
    ☐ add a quick cleanup mode to change periods to spaces
    ☐ Quick feature to remove `!` and other stuff from Lexica

Specific problems:
    ☐ http://localhost:3000/group/06236dd2-d7a5-4bc7-8129-38fe28fd5343
        ☐ Figure out why the `castle + drawbridge` image is generated multiple times
