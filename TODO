DALL-E related:
    ☐ Disable cfg, seed, and steps for `DALL-E` types
    ☐ show engine selection on the cards
    ☐ Give engine as a choice in the variables
    ☐ Figure out how to handle the grid when using DALL-E since seed is not real - maybe use `seed` even though it's not real?

Variants and related:
    ☐ Need to allow prompt to change along with other SD settings
    ☐ Create a view that tracks the history of variants

Image Grid:
    ☐ main image is being lost when the grid reloads -- find some way to not lose this @critical
    ☐ add ability to compare images side by side
    ☐ tighten the table visuals to reduce white space
    ☐ provide a simple way to get random seeds to test with 
    ☐ show active prompt for main image (and other details too?)
    ☐ update the diff count to show total size of artist list
    ☐ add `imageSize` back into the settings - control with a slider in ticks of 50px this time

    ☐ ability to change sort order of grid -- default appears to be descending

Sub Chooser related:
    ☐ Allow a choice to use either the modal selections or all active items in group

Random:
    ☐ allow deleting single images
    ☐ allow creating new groups from an existing study or survey -- keep the image url -- add a `prevGroupId` -- new groupId -- new image id?
    ☐ add a 1D / walk mode which tracks the `previousId` and shows as a directed acyclic graph
    ☐ try the `AppShell` for the NavBar and other stuff

Prompt editor:
    ☐ add a quick cleanup mode to change periods to spaces
