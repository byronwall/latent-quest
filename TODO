Image Grid:
    ☐ add ability to compare images side by side
    ☐ tighten the table visuals to reduce white space
    ☐ main image is being lost when the grid reloads -- find some way to not lose this
    ☐ provide a simple way to get random seeds to test with 
    ☐ show active prompt for main image (and other details too?)
    ☐ update the diff count to show total size of artist list
    ☐ add `imageSize` back into the settings - control with a slider in ticks of 50px this time

    ☐ load the images and group data server side to improve first render speed (avoid bump when group data comes through)

Random:
    ☐ allow deleting single images
    ☐ allow creating new groups from an existing study or survey -- keep the image url -- add a `prevGroupId` -- new groupId -- new image id?
    ☐ add a 1D / walk mode which tracks the `previousId` and shows as a directed acyclic graph

Prompt editor:
    ☐ add a quick cleanup mode to change periods to spaces
