Immediate:
    ☐ Rework prompt storage to just be text -- use fancy UX to handle parts but store as text
    ☐ The text transform will now be a "set" to the new one -- different places can diff if they want
    ☐ Rework the different diff tools to use a text prompt

Image Grid:
    ☐ add ability to compare images side by side
    ☐ add an option for no grid display - just all images in a list - this mode can also show deltas to a main image -- help to get a feel for the complete set of options
    ☐ add a 1D mode with wrapping
    ☐ sort out errant click events which change the main image
    ☐ tighten the table visuals to reduce white space
    ☐ Add a mechanism to tag part of the prompt for substitution
    ☐ main image is being lost when the grid reloads -- find some way to not lose this
    ☐ seeing duplicate entries from the `extraChoices` -- need to dedupe better
    ☐ add a `gen all missing` button to quickly fill out the grid
    ☐ saved view should save the `mainImage` id too
