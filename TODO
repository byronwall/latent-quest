Image Grid:
    ☐ figure out how to sort the transform with the main image between the add and remove
    ☐ remove dupes when showing transform
    ☐ add the main image in by doing a null transform
    ☐ add ability to compare images side by side
    ☐ add an option for no grid display - just all images in a list - this mode can also show deltas to a main image -- help to get a feel for the complete set of options
    ☐ add a 1D mode with wrapping
    ☐ ensure that full prompt is shown for the main image
    ☐ get the numeric xforms to work with the new xform generator
    ☐ sort out errant click events which change the main image
    ☐ tighten the table visuals to reduce white space
