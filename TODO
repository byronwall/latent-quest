Sub builder:
    ☐ Add a quick build to run X new seeds from the same image

Image editor:
    ☐ Allow for assorted brush strokes to add splotches of color

    ☐ Improve out painting controls:
        ☐ Ability to move image around
        ☐ Add some default pixels instead of black bars

Dream Studio:
    ☐ Catch error related to bad prompt: `a highly detailed epic cinematic concept art, a thin man in a black coat and bowler hat talks with  young girl who is dressed in a red coat`
        ☐ "Young girl" is not allowed -- get error back to user

DALL-E related:
    ☐ Figure out how to handle the grid when using DALL-E since seed is not real - maybe use `seed` even though it's not real?

Variants and related:
    ☐ Allow the variant strength to be part of the image grid

Group viewer:
    ☐ Add a proper modal to the preview button for the main ImageList view -- maybe limit the number of images
    ☐ Allow studies to be shown on the main ImageList view

Image Grid:
    ☐ show active prompt for main image (and other details too?)
    ☐ add `imageSize` back into the settings - control with a slider in ticks of 50px this time

    ☐ ability to change sort order of grid -- default appears to be descending
    ☐ sort by date within the groups so new images are first
    ☐ Use a sticky or something for the previous image so it's always in frame
    ☐ Show the total number of `gen all` options that will be generated for a study (avoid massive requests)

    ☐ Allow choosing the preview image(s) for the social graph image
    
    ☐ Need to exclude images generate with variants and image prompts from inclusion in the grid choices
    ☐ Add a `gen all` button for each row/col of the grid?

Image studies:
    ☐ Figure out how to get the "open in new tab" link available for a just saved study
    ☐ Choose whether or not to show the main image in the grid when other forces/excludes are in place
    ☐ Give options around multi-value subs -- filter any or exact match
    ☐ allow for a user defined note to be the grid variable - useful for image prompts where the user can describe what they were doing
    ☐ Forced choices should include the values for the main image
    ☐ Ability to edit an image in the grid
    ☐ Ability to compare images when the study modal is open (button is behind backdrop)
    ☐ Consider setting prevImageId = main image when the grid is run

Card viewer:
    ☐ Find some way to mark "study" images as part of a grid instead of as previous images

Sub Chooser related:
    ☐ Allow a choice to use either the modal selections or all active items in group
    ☐ Add a context which is able to tell if a given placeholder has a matching image in the existing group - use this to prevent sub chooser from running dupes

Random:
    ☐ allow deleting single images
    ☐ allow creating new groups from an existing study or survey -- keep the image url -- add a `prevGroupId` -- new groupId -- new image id?
    ☐ add a 1D / walk mode which tracks the `previousId` and shows as a directed acyclic graph
    ☐ try the `AppShell` for the NavBar and other stuff
    ☐ Allow rating or loving images / sub values -- start to aggregate "good" or "popular" choices instead of very long lists
    ☐ Ability to search Lexica and bring an image into current study
    ☐ Custom variant strength does not work?
    ☐ Ensure that exisitng image data is loaded if a known image+mask URL are submitted
    ☐ For the prevImageId view, give some sort of summary or indication for what was changed
    ☐ Swap over to the REST API for DreamStudio: https://api.stability.ai/docs#tag/v1alphageneration/operation/v1alpha/generation#imageToImage
    ☐ Some issue with image selection where related images are selected

Prompt editor:
    ☐ add a quick cleanup mode to change periods to spaces
    ☐ Quick feature to remove `!` and other stuff from Lexica

Specific problems:
    ☐ http://localhost:3000/group/06236dd2-d7a5-4bc7-8129-38fe28fd5343
        ☐ Figure out why the `castle + drawbridge` image is generated multiple times
