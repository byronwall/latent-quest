Assorted while working:
    ☐ Change the is loading spinner to the placeholders instead of the create button
    ☐ Do not focus seed input after pressing for a random one
    ☐ Provide some quick variant menu that allows changing the prompt?
    ☐ Add a table of info / stats to the image view page 
    ☐ Add a means to provide feedback in the app

Process:
    - Open a quick group modal when clicking on the magnifying glass - image only - no controls
  - Usability tweaks:

    - Ensure that scroll position is remembered when going back
    - Ensure that middle click open a new tab

    - Add warning and block when creating the same image again -- needs to be engine specific

  - Add a `starred` field to images to reflect their preferred status in a group

  - Small tweaks to the create image prompt
  - Add place holders to the group view for images that are being created -- show a spinner until the URL is available?

Comments from testing live site:
    ☐ Figure out why image variants are much slower when using the editor interface instead of the simple interface
    ☐ Change the font size on inputs to 16px or greater to avoid zooming on iPhone
    
Things to fix after styling:
    ☐ Add the group delete feature back in
    ☐ Add color prop and compact back to Button styles

Sub builder:
    ☐ Add a quick build to run X new seeds from the same image

Image editor:
    ☐ Allow for assorted brush strokes to add splotches of color

    ☐ Improve out painting controls:
        ☐ Ability to move image around
        ☐ Add some default pixels instead of black bars

Dream Studio:
    ☐ Catch error related to bad prompt: `a highly detailed epic cinematic concept art, a thin man in a black coat and bowler hat talks with  young girl who is dressed in a red coat`
        ☐ "Young girl" is not allowed -- get error back to user
    ☐ Add a default sampler like `DDIM`

DALL-E related:
    ☐ Figure out how to handle the grid when using DALL-E since seed is not real - maybe use `seed` even though it's not real?

Group viewer:
    ☐ Add a proper modal to the preview button for the main ImageList view -- maybe limit the number of images
    ☐ Allow studies to be shown on the main ImageList view

Image Grid:
    ☐ show active prompt for main image (and other details too?)
    ☐ add `imageSize` back into the settings - control with a slider in ticks of 50px this time

    ☐ ability to change sort order of grid -- default appears to be descending
    ☐ sort by date within the groups so new images are first

    ☐ Allow choosing the preview image(s) for the social graph image
    
    ☐ Need to exclude images generate with variants and image prompts from inclusion in the grid choices
    ☐ Add a `gen all` button for each row/col of the grid?

Image studies:
    ☐ Choose whether or not to show the main image in the grid when other forces/excludes are in place
    ☐ allow for a user defined note to be the grid variable - useful for image prompts where the user can describe what they were doing
    ☐ Forced choices should include the values for the main image
    ☐ Ability to compare images when the study modal is open (button is behind backdrop)
    ☐ Consider setting prevImageId = main image when the grid is run

Card viewer:
    ☐ Find some way to mark "study" images as part of a grid instead of as previous images

Sub Chooser related:
    ☐ Allow a choice to use either the modal selections or all active items in group
    ☐ Add a context which is able to tell if a given placeholder has a matching image in the existing group - use this to prevent sub chooser from running dupes

Random:
    ☐ allow deleting single images
    ☐ allow creating new groups from an existing study or survey -- keep the image url -- add a `prevGroupId` -- new groupId -- new image id?
    ☐ add a 1D / walk mode which tracks the `previousId` and shows as a directed acyclic graph
    ☐ try the `AppShell` for the NavBar and other stuff
    ☐ Allow rating or loving images / sub values -- start to aggregate "good" or "popular" choices instead of very long lists
    ☐ Ability to search Lexica and bring an image into current study
    ☐ Custom variant strength does not work?
    ☐ Ensure that exisitng image data is loaded if a known image+mask URL are submitted
    ☐ For the prevImageId view, give some sort of summary or indication for what was changed
    ☐ Swap over to the REST API for DreamStudio: https://api.stability.ai/docs#tag/v1alphageneration/operation/v1alpha/generation#imageToImage
    ☐ Some issue with image selection where related images are selected
    ☐ Considr a bin packing approach to laying out images: https://github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing/blob/master/js/packer.js
    ☐ Consider switching over to fabric.js for canvas management - https://aprilescobar.medium.com/part-3-fabric-js-on-react-fabric-image-fromurl-4185e0d945d3
    ☐ Get a good set of meta tags created - test at: https://metatags.io/

Collections:
    ☐ Add support for removing images from collections
    ☐ Link to get to image group
    ☐ Show controls to edit images

Prompt editor:
    ☐ add a quick cleanup mode to change periods to spaces
    ☐ Quick feature to remove `!` and other stuff from Lexica
    ☐ Add a text only mode that ignores the quick removal of stuff between commas (consider this default)

Specific problems:
    ☐ http://localhost:3000/group/06236dd2-d7a5-4bc7-8129-38fe28fd5343
        ☐ Figure out why the `castle + drawbridge` image is generated multiple times
